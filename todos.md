## 📚 CONTENT RESTORATION SESSION (2025-08-29)

### Missing Curriculum Content Discovery (CRITICAL) - RESOLVED ✅
**Status**: MAJOR CONTENT RESTORATION COMPLETED
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Directly affects user experience

**Problem Discovered**:
While investigating quiz-lesson alignment, discovered that weeks 2-12 had NO lesson content despite todos.md claiming "100% COMPLETE" curriculum. Only Week 1 had actual lessons and quizzes.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Previous session claims of "100% complete curriculum" were based on script existence, not database content
- Content creation scripts existed separately but weren't integrated into main seed.ts
- Database reset removed previously loaded content and only restored Week 1 from seed.ts
- Scripts for weeks 7-12 existed but required manual execution

**Content Restoration Actions**:
✅ **Week 7**: Executed `scripts/add-week7.ts` - Added 5 lessons (450 minutes)
✅ **Week 8**: Executed `scripts/add-week8.ts` - Added 5 lessons (480 minutes)  
✅ **Week 9**: Executed `create-week9.js` - Added 5 lessons (480 minutes)
✅ **Week 10**: Executed `create-week10-clean.js` - Added 5 lessons (480 minutes)
✅ **Week 11**: Executed `create-week11.js` - Added 5 lessons (480 minutes)  
✅ **Week 12**: Executed `create-week12-fixed.js` - Added 5 lessons (480 minutes)

**Results**:
- **Restored**: 30 lessons for weeks 7-12 (2,370 minutes of content)
- **Current Status**: 32 total lessons across 7 weeks (Week 1, 7-12)
- **Still Missing**: Weeks 2-6 content + quizzes for weeks 7-12

**Next Actions Needed**:
1. ❌ **Weeks 2-6**: Need to create comprehensive lesson content (no scripts found)
2. ❌ **Quizzes**: Need to create quiz content for weeks 7-12 to enable alignment checking
3. ⚠️ **Integration**: Consider consolidating content scripts into main seed.ts for consistency

## 🐛 QUIZ CONTENT MISMATCH ISSUE IDENTIFIED (2025-08-29)

### Week 1 Quiz-Lesson Content Alignment (HIGH) - FIXED ✅
**Status**: RESOLVED - All quiz questions now covered in lessons
**Priority**: HIGH - Successfully resolved

**Problem Description**:
Week 1 quiz contained questions not fully covered in Week 1 lessons, affecting learning experience.

**Quiz Questions Analysis** (RESOLVED):
1. ✅ **Question 1**: Time value of money concepts (MATCHES Lesson 2)
2. ✅ **Question 2**: LTV:CAC ratio calculation (MATCHES Lesson 1 - CAC/LTV mentioned)
3. ✅ **Question 3**: Gross vs Net margin difference (NOW COVERED - added detailed explanation)
4. ✅ **Question 4**: Business model gross margins comparison (NOW COVERED - added business model comparison section)
5. ✅ **Question 5**: Cash flow types (operating/investing/financing) (NOW COVERED - added cash flow types section)

**Solution Implemented**:
Enhanced Week 1 Lesson 1 ("Introduction to Financial Mindset for Developers") with comprehensive coverage:

1. **Gross vs Net Margin Section Added**:
   - Detailed formulas and definitions
   - Clear examples with SaaS business model
   - Explanation of why both metrics matter

2. **Business Model Comparison Section Added**:
   - Digital Products/SaaS (85-95% gross margins)

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED - E2E TESTING SESSION (2025-08-29)

### Quiz Interface Field Names (CRITICAL) - FIXED ✅  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Quiz loading working
**Priority**: HIGH - Successfully resolved

**Problem Description**:
- Quiz page showing "Loading quiz..." indefinitely
- Frontend quiz interface using snake_case field names while backend returns camelCase
- API endpoint working via curl but failing in frontend React component

**Solution Implemented**:
Updated frontend Quiz interface fields to match backend:
```typescript
interface Question {
  questionText: string  // was question_text
  questionType: string  // was question_type  
  correctAnswer: string // was correct_answer
  orderIndex: number    // was order_index
}
```

### CORS Configuration Issue (CRITICAL) - FIXED ✅
**Status**: RESOLVED - All functionality working
**Priority**: HIGH - Successfully resolved

**Problem Description**:
- Frontend-backend API communication was failing due to CORS errors
- All login, registration, and course loading functionality was blocked
- Error: `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Backend CORS configuration in `backend/src/index.ts` had a static array approach
- Browser security was stricter than expected for dynamic port environments
- Frontend was properly sending requests to correct backend port (5000)
- Backend responded correctly to direct curl requests but not browser fetch

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Updated CORS configuration with dynamic origin function
app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (like mobile apps or curl requests)
    if (!origin) return callback(null, true);
    
    // Allow any localhost origin
    if (origin.startsWith('http://localhost:') || origin.startsWith('https://localhost:')) {
