## Previously Fixed Issues âœ…

### 1. Week/Lesson Navigation Issue (CRITICAL) - FIXED âœ…
- **Problem**: Week links generating URLs with "undefined"
- **Root Cause**: Database weeks missing proper week_number values
- **Solution**: Created and ran database fix script to populate week numbers 1-12
- **Frontend Fix**: Updated field references from `week.week_number` to `week.weekNumber`
- **Result**: Week navigation now works, URLs show `/week/1`, `/week/2`, etc.

### 2. Profile Page Implementation (MEDIUM) - FIXED âœ…  
- **Problem**: `/profile` returned 404 error
- **Solution**: Created complete profile page component with user info, stats, and edit functionality

- **Features**: View/edit profile, display learning statistics, authentication protection
- **Result**: Profile page now accessible and functional

- **Problem**: Logged-out users could see dashboard content
- **Solution**: Added authentication guards with automatic redirect
- **Implementation**: Added `useAuthStore` checks and `useRouter` redirect logic
- **Result**: Unauthorized users now see "Redirecting..." message and are redirected to login

### 4. Lesson Content Display (MEDIUM) - FIXED âœ…
- **Problem**: All weeks showed "0 lessons" despite having lesson data
- **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch (frontend used `lesson_count`, backend sent `lessonCount`)
- **Solution**: Updated frontend to use camelCase field names (`lessonCount`, `estimatedHours`)
- **Result**: Weeks now show proper lesson counts (Week 1: 2 lessons, etc.)

### 5. Analytics Page Missing (HIGH) - FIXED âœ…
- **Problem**: `/analytics` returned 404 error
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive analytics page with learning metrics
