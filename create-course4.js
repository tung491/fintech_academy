## Understanding When to Record Revenue

Revenue recognition determines **when** you record revenue, not just **how much**. For tech businesses, this is crucial due to various revenue streams and payment structures.

## The Revenue Recognition Principle

Revenue should be recognized when it is **earned**, not necessarily when cash is received.

### Key Questions:
- When have you fulfilled your obligation to the customer?
- What performance obligations do you have?
- Over what period should revenue be recognized?

## Revenue Recognition by Business Model

### 1. SaaS (Software as a Service)

#### Monthly Subscriptions
Customer pays $100/month for your software.
- January payment of $100 = $100 revenue in January
- Revenue is earned as you provide the service each month

**Journal Entry:**
\`\`\`
Debit: Cash                     $100
Credit: SaaS Subscription Revenue  $100
\`\`\`

#### Annual Subscriptions Paid Upfront
Customer pays $1,200 for a full year upfront.
- Revenue must be spread over 12 months ($100/month)

**Initial Entry (when payment received):**
\`\`\`
Debit: Cash                    $1,200
Credit: Deferred Revenue       $1,200
\`\`\`

**Monthly Recognition Entry:**
\`\`\`
Debit: Deferred Revenue         $100
Credit: SaaS Subscription Revenue  $100
\`\`\`

### 2. Custom Development Projects

#### Fixed-Price Projects
$50,000 website development project, 3-month timeline.

**Percentage of Completion Method:**
- Month 1: 30% complete = $15,000 revenue
- Month 2: 60% complete = $15,000 revenue  
- Month 3: 100% complete = $20,000 revenue

#### Time and Materials Projects
$150/hour consulting, bill monthly.
- Revenue recognized as hours are worked

### 3. Retainer Arrangements

#### Monthly Retainer
Client pays $5,000/month for ongoing support.
- Recognized monthly as service is provided

#### Prepaid Retainer  
Client pays $15,000 for 3 months upfront.
- Initially record as deferred revenue
- Recognize $5,000 per month as services provided

## Key Accounting Concepts

### Deferred Revenue (Unearned Revenue)
- Money received for services not yet provided
- Listed as a liability on balance sheet
- Common in: Annual subscriptions, project deposits

### Accounts Receivable
- Money owed for services already provided
- Listed as an asset on balance sheet
- Common in: Monthly billing, completed projects

### Accrued Revenue
- Revenue earned but not yet billed
- Listed as an asset on balance sheet
- Common in: Time-based billing, work in progress

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Business Mixed Billing
Task management software: $29/month or $290/year

**January Transactions:**
- 100 monthly subscribers: $2,900 (immediate recognition)
- 20 annual subscribers: $5,800 total, $483.33/month recognition

### Example 2: Development Agency
Current projects:
1. E-commerce site: $40,000, 60% complete = $24,000 revenue
2. Mobile app: $25,000, completed = $25,000 revenue
3. Monthly retainer: $2,000 = $2,000 revenue

## Special Situations

### Refunds and Credits
Customer requests $100 refund:
\`\`\`
Debit: SaaS Subscription Revenue  $100
Credit: Cash                      $100
\`\`\`

### Payment Processing Fees
Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 on $100 payment:
\`\`\`
Debit: Cash                     $96.80
Debit: Payment Processing Fees  $3.20
Credit: SaaS Revenue           $100.00
\`\`\`

## Setting Up Your Revenue Recording System

Let's implement a practical system for recording revenue that handles multiple streams while maintaining accuracy and compliance.

## Invoice Management Workflow

### 1. SaaS Subscription Billing

**Monthly Recurring Setup in QuickBooks:**
1. Go to Sales ‚Üí Recurring Transactions
2. Create template with customer details
3. Set frequency and dates

**Sample Invoice:**
\`\`\`
Customer: TechCorp Inc.
Date: January 1, 2024

- Project Management Software (Monthly) - $100.00
- Additional Users (5 √ó $20) - $100.00  
- Advanced Analytics Add-on - $50.00

Total: $250.00
Terms: Due on receipt
\`\`\`

### 2. Project-Based Invoicing

**Development Project Invoice:**
\`\`\`
Project: E-commerce Platform Development
Customer: StartupXYZ

Phase 1: Design (Complete)
- UI/UX Design (40 hours √ó $125) - $5,000
- Project Planning (8 hours √ó $150) - $1,200

Phase 2: Development (50% Complete)  
- Frontend (60 hours √ó $125) - $7,500
- Backend (40 hours √ó $135) - $5,400

Total: $19,100
Terms: Net 30
\`\`\`

## Revenue Recognition Entries

### Immediate Recognition
For completed work and monthly subscriptions:

**QuickBooks automatically creates:**
\`\`\`
Debit: Accounts Receivable    $250
Credit: SaaS Revenue         $250
\`\`\`

**When payment received:**
\`\`\`
Debit: Cash                  $250
Credit: Accounts Receivable  $250
\`\`\`

### Deferred Revenue Handling

**Annual subscription $2,400 paid upfront:**

**Step 1: Create invoice and receive payment**
**Step 2: Defer revenue with journal entry**
\`\`\`
Debit: Revenue Account       $2,400
Credit: Deferred Revenue     $2,400
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Monthly recognition**
\`\`\`
Debit: Deferred Revenue      $200
Credit: SaaS Revenue        $200
\`\`\`

## Revenue Tracking by Stream

### Revenue Accounts Setup
- 4000 - Basic Subscription Revenue
- 4010 - Premium Subscription Revenue  
- 4020 - Enterprise Subscription Revenue
- 4100 - Custom Development Revenue
- 4120 - Maintenance Revenue

### Monthly Revenue Dashboard

**Key SaaS Metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- New MRR vs. Churned MRR
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

**Sample Report:**
\`\`\`
JANUARY 2024 REVENUE SUMMARY

SaaS Subscriptions:
- Basic Plans (50 √ó $50)        $2,500
- Premium Plans (25 √ó $150)     $3,750  
- Enterprise (5 √ó $500)         $2,500
Total MRR                       $8,750

One-time Services:
- Setup Fees                    $1,200

- Training                      $2,500
Total One-time                 $18,700

TOTAL REVENUE                  $27,450
\`\`\`

## Payment Processing Integration

### Automated Recording with Stripe

\`\`\`
Debit: Stripe Account           $97.10
Debit: Payment Processing Fees  $2.90
Credit: SaaS Revenue           $100.00

\`\`\`

## Work-in-Progress Tracking

For ongoing projects:

**Time Entry System:**
- Track hours by project and task
- Set billing rates by role
- Generate progress reports

**Monthly WIP Entry:**
\`\`\`
Work completed but not billed:
Developer hours: 40 √ó $125 = $5,000
Design hours: 15 √ó $100 = $1,500
Total WIP: $6,500

Journal Entry:
Debit: Work in Progress Asset   $6,500
Credit: Development Revenue     $6,500
\`\`\`

## Quality Control Procedures

### Monthly Revenue Review
- [ ] All monthly subscriptions billed
- [ ] Annual subscriptions properly deferred  
- [ ] Project progress updated
- [ ] WIP calculations accurate
- [ ] All payments reconciled

### Revenue Validation Questions
1. Does revenue match cash flow expectations?
2. Are deferred revenue balances reasonable?
3. Have all completed milestones been billed?
4. Are recognition policies followed consistently?

## Revenue Forecasting

### SaaS Projections
\`\`\`
Current MRR: $10,000
New customers: 10/month √ó $50 = $500
Churn: 5% monthly = ($500)
Net growth: $0

Projected MRR remains stable at $10,000
\`\`\`
