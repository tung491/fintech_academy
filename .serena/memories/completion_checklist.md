# FinAcademy Task Completion Checklist

## After Every Development Task

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run frontend linting
cd frontend && npm run lint

# Check TypeScript compilation (backend)
cd backend && npm run build

# Check TypeScript compilation (frontend)  
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### 2. Testing (Manual - No automated tests currently)
- Verify application starts successfully
- Test affected functionality manually
- Check both authenticated and unauthenticated flows
- Verify responsive design works

### 3. Database Verification
```bash
# If database changes were made, verify migrations
cd backend && npm run db:migrate

# If seed data changes, re-seed database
cd backend && npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Development Server Testing
```bash
# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Verify both services are running:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

### 5. Git Workflow (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: description of what was implemented"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Update `plans.md` with completed tasks
- Update `todos.md` to reflect current status
- Add any new features to README.md if significant

## Pre-Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths
- [ ] Security review of new code
- [ ] Performance testing if applicable

## Current Known Issues to Monitor
- No automated test suite (should be added)
- No error tracking system (consider Sentry)
- No performance monitoring
- No CI/CD pipeline (manual deployment)

## Priority Items for Next Tasks
1. Implement automated testing (Jest/Cypress)
2. Add error tracking and monitoring  
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Add comprehensive logging
5. Implement proper error boundaries
