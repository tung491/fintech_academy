Understanding Risk Relationships:
Risk events often correlate, creating compound effects that simple risk registers miss.

Common Developer Risk Correlations:
- Economic downturns → Client budget cuts → Project cancellations
- Key person departure → Knowledge loss → Project delays → Client dissatisfaction
- Security incident → Reputation damage → New client acquisition difficulty
- Technology obsolescence → Skill gaps → Competitive disadvantage

### Scenario Planning and Stress Testing

**Scenario Development Process**

**1. Scenario Identification**
Types of Scenarios for Developers:
- **Economic Scenarios**: Recession, boom periods, inflation
- **Technology Scenarios**: Platform changes, new frameworks, disruption
- **Competitive Scenarios**: New entrants, price wars, market consolidation
- **Regulatory Scenarios**: Privacy law changes, tax modifications, compliance

**2. Scenario Quantification**
Economic Recession Scenario:
- Client budget reductions: 30%
- Project cancellation rate: 15%
- Payment delays: +45 days average
- New client acquisition: -50%
- Hourly rate pressure: -10%

Impact Analysis:
- Revenue reduction: 35%
- Cash flow delay: 2 months
- Operating margin: -60%
- Survival timeline: 8 months with current reserves
