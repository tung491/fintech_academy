## Introduction to Schedule C

Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business) is the tax form used by sole proprietorships and single-member LLCs to report business income and expenses. As the simplest business tax filing, it's often the starting point for many entrepreneurs and developers.

## Who Must File Schedule C

### Eligible Entities
- **Sole Proprietorships**: Unincorporated businesses owned by one individual
- **Single-Member LLCs**: LLCs with only one owner (disregarded entity status)
- **Married couples**: Joint ventures between spouses in community property states

### Business Activity Requirements
Your business must have:
- Profit motive (intent to make money)
- Regular and continuous activity
- Business-like operations

## Schedule C Structure and Key Sections

Schedule C is divided into several parts that capture your business income and expenses for the tax year.

### Part I: Income
This section reports your gross business income:
- Line 1: Gross receipts or sales
- Line 2: Returns and allowances  
- Line 3: Subtract line 2 from line 1
- Line 4: Cost of goods sold (from Part III)
- Line 5: Gross profit (line 3 minus line 4)
- Line 6: Other income
- Line 7: Gross income (line 5 plus line 6)

### Part II: Expenses
**Common Deductible Expenses for Developers:**
- Advertising and marketing
- Car and truck expenses (business use)
- Commissions and fees
- Contract labor (1099 contractors you hired)
- Equipment depreciation
- Insurance (professional liability, E&O)
- Interest on business loans
- Legal and professional services
- Office expenses and supplies
- Rent or lease expenses
- Repairs and maintenance
- Software subscriptions and licenses
- Travel expenses
- Utilities (if home office)
- Other business expenses

### Software Development Specific Deductions
Technology Expenses:
- Development software licenses
- Cloud hosting and server costs
- API access fees
- Testing and monitoring tools
- Code repositories and version control
- Design software and assets

Professional Development:
- Conference attendance
- Online courses and certifications
- Technical books and publications
- Professional memberships

## Advantages of Schedule C Filing

### Simplicity
- Filed with personal Form 1040
- No separate tax return required
- Straightforward income and expense reporting

### Pass-Through Taxation
- Business profits/losses flow to personal return
- No double taxation
- Losses can offset other income

### Full Deductibility
- 100% of business expenses are deductible
- Home office deduction available
- Equipment depreciation or Section 179 expensing

## Disadvantages and Limitations

### Self-Employment Tax
- Subject to SE tax (15.3%) on net business income
- No employer contribution to Social Security/Medicare
- Applies to entire net profit

### Personal Liability
- No legal separation between personal and business assets
- Unlimited personal liability for business debts
- Professional liability insurance crucial

### Limited Tax Benefits
- No employee benefit deductions for self
- Limited retirement plan options compared to corporations
- No salary/distribution split opportunities

## Common Schedule C Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Mixing Personal and Business Expenses
Only business expenses are deductible. Personal expenses cannot be claimed.

### 2. Inadequate Record Keeping
**Required Documentation:**
- Receipts for all expenses
- Mileage logs for vehicle expenses  
- Home office measurement and expenses
- Bank statements showing business transactions

### 3. Misclassifying Workers
**Critical Test:** If you control how work is done (not just what work is done), they're likely an employee, not a contractor

### 4. Overlooking Business Use of Home
Many developers miss this valuable deduction:
- Percentage of home used exclusively for business
- Direct expenses (office furniture, business phone)
- Indirect expenses (utilities, insurance, maintenance)

## Schedule C vs Other Entity Elections

### When Schedule C Makes Sense
- Simple business structure
- Low liability risk
- Starting out or testing business viability
- Prefer simplicity over tax optimization

### When to Consider Alternatives
- High income (SE tax becomes burdensome)
- Significant liability exposure
- Want employee benefits
- Multiple owners
- Seeking investment or planning to scale

## Real-World Example: Web Developer

**Sarah's Solo Development Business:**
- Gross Income: $85,000
- Software licenses: $2,400
- Equipment depreciation: $3,500
- Home office: $4,800
- Professional development: $1,500
- Internet/phone: $1,200
- Professional insurance: $800
- Total Expenses: $14,200

Net Profit: $70,800
Self-Employment Tax: $9,996 (14.1% effective rate)
Income Tax: Variable based on total household income

## Key Takeaways

1. **Schedule C is for sole proprietorships and single-member LLCs**
2. **All net business income is subject to self-employment tax**
3. **Proper record keeping is essential for audit protection**
4. **Home office and equipment deductions can provide significant tax savings**
5. **Consider entity changes as income grows or liability increases**

        content: `# Form 1120 and 1120S: Corporate Tax Returns Explained

## Understanding Corporate Tax Structures

When your business grows beyond sole proprietorship or single-member LLC status, you enter the world of corporate taxation. This involves more complex tax returns but potentially significant tax advantages.

## Form 1120: C-Corporation Tax Return

### What is a C-Corporation?

A C-Corporation is a separate legal entity that:
- Exists independently from its owners (shareholders)
- Has unlimited life
- Can have multiple classes of stock
- Provides complete liability protection
- Faces "double taxation" on profits

### Form 1120 Structure and Key Components

**Income Section**
- Gross receipts or sales
- Cost of goods sold
- Capital gains and losses
- Other income sources

**Deductions Section - Corporate-Specific Deductions:**
- Compensation of officers
- Salaries and wages (including payroll taxes)
- Bad debts
- Business insurance premiums
- Depreciation
- Advertising expenses
- Professional services
- Office expenses

**Tax Calculation**
2024 Corporate Tax Rates:
- Flat 21% federal rate on all corporate income
- State corporate taxes vary by state
- Additional taxes may apply (AMT, etc.)

### Advantages of C-Corporation Election

#### 1. Salary vs Distribution Strategy
Total Compensation Example: $100,000

Option A - All Salary:
- Salary: $100,000
- Payroll taxes: $15,300
- Total cost: $115,300

Option B - Salary + Distribution:
- Salary: $60,000
- Payroll taxes: $9,180
- Distribution: $40,000
- Corporate tax (21%): $8,400
- Owner tax (qualified dividends): $6,000
- Total taxes: $23,580 vs $15,300 (higher due to double taxation)

#### 2. Employee Benefits
- Health insurance deductions
- Retirement plan contributions
- Life insurance premiums
- Educational assistance programs

#### 3. Business Expense Advantages
- 100% deductible business meals (temporary through 2024)
- Entertainment expenses (limited)
- Company car benefits
- Professional development

### Disadvantages of C-Corporation

#### Double Taxation
- Corporate profits taxed at 21%
- Distributions taxed as dividends to shareholders
- Can result in higher overall tax burden

#### Complexity and Compliance
- Quarterly estimated taxes
- Annual tax return filing
- Corporate minutes and resolutions
- Separate business bank accounts

## Form 1120S: S-Corporation Tax Return

### What is an S-Corporation?

An S-Corporation is a special tax election that:
- Provides liability protection like a C-Corp
- Offers pass-through taxation like an LLC
- Has restrictions on shareholders and stock classes
- Requires reasonable salary for owner-employees

### S-Corporation Eligibility Requirements

**Shareholder Limitations**
- Maximum 100 shareholders
- All shareholders must be US citizens or residents
- No corporate or partnership shareholders
- Only one class of stock (voting differences allowed)

**Entity Requirements**
- Must be domestic corporation
- Cannot be certain types of businesses (banks, insurance companies)
- Cannot have nonresident alien shareholders

### Form 1120S Structure

Unlike Form 1120, Form 1120S:
- Reports income and expenses
- Calculates profit/loss
- Issues K-1s to shareholders
- Generally pays no federal income tax

**Key Schedule K-1 Items**
- Ordinary business income/loss
- Net rental real estate income/loss
- Other net rental income/loss
- Interest income
- Dividend income
- Royalties
- Net short-term capital gain/loss
- Net long-term capital gain/loss
- Section 179 deduction
- Charitable contributions

### S-Corporation Tax Advantages

#### 1. Self-Employment Tax Savings
Example: $100,000 total business income

Sole Proprietorship:
- SE tax on $100,000 = $14,130

S-Corporation:
- Reasonable salary: $60,000
- SE tax (payroll) on $60,000 = $9,180
- Distribution: $40,000 (no SE tax)
- Total SE tax savings: $4,950 annually

#### 2. Pass-Through Benefits
- Losses flow through to personal returns
- No double taxation
- Step-up in basis for distributions

#### 3. Flexibility in Tax Planning
- Income timing flexibility
- Charitable contribution strategies
- Retirement plan contributions

### S-Corporation Requirements and Pitfalls

#### Reasonable Salary Requirement
**IRS Standard:** Owner-employees must receive "reasonable compensation" for services

**Factors IRS Considers:**
- Training and experience
- Duties and responsibilities
- Time and effort devoted
- Payments to non-shareholder employees
- Compensation agreements
- Use of capital vs personal services

**Common Mistake:**
Incorrect: $120,000 profit, $20,000 salary, $100,000 distribution
Correct: $120,000 profit, $60,000 salary, $60,000 distribution

## Comparison: Schedule C vs 1120 vs 1120S

### Tax Treatment Comparison
$100,000 Business Income Example:

Schedule C (Sole Prop):
- Income tax: ~$22,000 (22% bracket)
- SE tax: $14,130
- Total: ~$36,130

C-Corporation:
- Corporate tax: $21,000 (21%)
- Personal tax on $79,000 distribution: ~$11,850
- Total: ~$32,850 (but double taxation)

S-Corporation:
- Income tax: ~$22,000 (22% bracket)
- Payroll tax on reasonable salary: ~$8,000
- Total: ~$30,000 (savings from reduced SE tax)

## When to Choose Each Structure

### Choose Schedule C When:
- Simple business operations
- Low income (under $50,000)
- Starting out or uncertain about business viability
- Want maximum simplicity

### Choose C-Corporation When:
- High income with reinvestment plans
- Want maximum employee benefits
- Planning to seek outside investment
- Multiple shareholders or complex ownership

### Choose S-Corporation When:
- Moderate to high income ($75,000+)
- Want SE tax savings
- Desire liability protection
- Single or simple ownership structure

## Key Takeaways

1. **Schedule C is simplest but has SE tax on all income**
2. **C-Corporations face double taxation but offer maximum flexibility**
3. **S-Corporations provide pass-through benefits with SE tax savings**
4. **Entity choice should consider both tax and non-tax factors**
5. **Regular review ensures your structure remains optimal**
