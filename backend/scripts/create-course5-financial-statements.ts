## Understanding the Profit & Loss Statement

The Profit & Loss statement (P&L), also called the Income Statement, is one of the most important financial documents for any business. It shows your company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period, typically monthly, quarterly, or annually.

## Why P&L Analysis Matters for Founders

### Strategic Decision Making
- **Resource Allocation**: Where should you invest your limited resources?
- **Cost Management**: Which expenses are driving the best returns?
- **Pricing Strategy**: Are your prices supporting sustainable growth?
- **Growth Planning**: What revenue growth is realistic and sustainable?

### Investor Communication
- **Fundraising**: Investors scrutinize P&L statements to assess business viability
- **Board Reporting**: Regular P&L analysis demonstrates financial discipline
- **Valuation**: P&L trends directly impact company valuation

### Operational Excellence
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track business health in real-time
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and seasonal variations
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance against industry standards
- **Goal Setting**: Set realistic financial targets based on historical data

## Key P&L Components Explained

### 1. Revenue Section

#### Gross Sales
The total amount of sales before any deductions.

**For SaaS Businesses:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- One-time setup fees
- Professional services revenue

**For Service Businesses:**
- Consulting revenue
- Project-based income
- Retainer fees
- Training and support services

#### Revenue Adjustments
**Returns and Allowances:**
- Product returns
- Service credits
- Refunds issued

**Discounts:**
- Promotional discounts
- Early payment discounts
- Volume discounts
- Customer credits

#### Net Sales
The actual revenue after all adjustments. This is your "real" revenue number.

### 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

COGS represents the direct costs associated with producing your product or delivering your service.

#### Software/SaaS COGS:
- **Hosting and infrastructure** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Third-party APIs and services**
- **Payment processing fees**
- **Customer support costs**
- **Professional services delivery costs**

#### Service Business COGS:
- **Direct labor** (billable employee time)
- **Subcontractor costs**
- **Project-specific software licenses**
- **Travel expenses for client work**

#### Manufacturing COGS:
- **Raw materials**
- **Direct labor**
- **Factory overhead**
- **Shipping costs**

### 3. Gross Profit and Margin

**Calculation:**
Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS
Gross Margin = (Gross Profit √∑ Net Sales) √ó 100

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- **SaaS**: 75-85% gross margin
- **Software Services**: 60-75%
- **Consulting**: 50-70%
- **E-commerce**: 20-40%
- **Manufacturing**: 25-35%

**Example Analysis:**
\`\`\`
Month 1: Sales $100K, COGS $25K, Gross Margin 75%
Month 2: Sales $110K, COGS $30K, Gross Margin 72.7%
Month 3: Sales $120K, COGS $28K, Gross Margin 76.7%

Analysis: Gross margin improved in Month 3, indicating 
better cost control or pricing optimization.
\`\`\`

### 4. Operating Expenses

#### Sales & Marketing
**Customer Acquisition Costs:**
- Digital advertising (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Content marketing and SEO
- Trade shows and events
- Sales team compensation
- Marketing tools and software

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Marketing spend as % of revenue
- Cost per lead by channel
- Return on ad spend (ROAS)

#### Research & Development
**Innovation Investments:**
- Developer salaries and benefits
- Software development tools
- R&D equipment and infrastructure
- Patent and IP costs

**SaaS R&D Benchmarks:**

- Mature companies: 10-20% of revenue

#### General & Administrative (G&A)
**Business Operations:**
- Management salaries
- Office rent and utilities
- Legal and professional fees
- Insurance and licenses
- Accounting and bookkeeping

**G&A Benchmarks:**

- Early stage: Often higher (15-25%)
- Scale efficiently as revenue grows

### 5. Profitability Metrics

#### EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization)
**Purpose:** Shows operational profitability excluding financing and accounting decisions.

**Calculation:**
EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization

**Why It Matters:**
- Compares operational efficiency across companies
- Excludes one-time and non-cash items
- Common metric for valuations and investor discussions

#### EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)
**Purpose:** Shows profit from operations before financing costs.

**Use Cases:**
- Compare companies with different capital structures
- Assess operational efficiency
- Evaluate core business performance

#### Net Income
**The Bottom Line:** Final profit after all expenses, interest, and taxes.

**Net Margin Calculation:**
Net Margin = (Net Income √∑ Net Sales) √ó 100

## P&L Analysis Techniques

### 1. Vertical Analysis (Common-Size Analysis)

Express each line item as a percentage of net sales.

\`\`\`
Example Vertical Analysis:
                        Amount    % of Sales
Net Sales              $120,000     100.0%
COGS                    $28,000      23.3%
Gross Profit            $92,000      76.7%
Sales & Marketing       $43,500      36.3%
R&D                     $30,000      25.0%
G&A                     $27,000      22.5%
Total OpEx             $100,500      83.8%
EBITDA                  ($8,500)     -7.1%
\`\`\`

**Insights:**
- Gross margin is healthy at 76.7%
- Operating expenses are too high at 83.8% of revenue
- Need to either increase revenue or reduce expenses

### 2. Horizontal Analysis (Trend Analysis)

Compare performance across multiple periods.

\`\`\`
                    Jan 2024  Feb 2024  Mar 2024  Mar vs Jan
Net Sales           $100,000  $110,000  $120,000    +20.0%
COGS                 $25,000   $30,000   $28,000    +12.0%
Gross Profit         $75,000   $80,000   $92,000    +22.7%
Gross Margin           75.0%     72.7%     76.7%    +1.7pp

Sales & Marketing    $35,000   $40,000   $43,500    +24.3%
R&D                  $25,000   $28,000   $30,000    +20.0%
G&A                  $22,000   $24,000   $27,000    +22.7%
Total OpEx           $82,000   $92,000  $100,500    +22.6%

EBITDA              ($7,000)  ($12,000)  ($8,500)   -21.4%
\`\`\`

**Key Insights:**
- Revenue growing 20% over 3 months (good)
- COGS growing slower than revenue (improving efficiency)
- Operating expenses growing at same rate as revenue (concerning)
- EBITDA improving but still negative (need path to profitability)

### 3. Ratio Analysis

#### Profitability Ratios
- **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit √∑ Net Sales
- **Operating Margin** = Operating Profit √∑ Net Sales  
- **Net Margin** = Net Income √∑ Net Sales
- **EBITDA Margin** = EBITDA √∑ Net Sales

#### Efficiency Ratios
- **Revenue per Employee** = Net Sales √∑ Number of Employees
- **OpEx Ratio** = Operating Expenses √∑ Net Sales
- **Sales Efficiency** = Net Sales √∑ Sales & Marketing Expense

## Red Flags in P&L Analysis

### Revenue Red Flags
- **Declining revenue trends** without clear explanation
- **Heavy dependence on few customers** (revenue concentration)
- **Seasonal variations** not accounted for in planning
- **Revenue recognition issues** (aggressive accounting)

### Expense Red Flags
- **Operating expenses growing faster than revenue**
- **Gross margins declining** over time
- **Unusually high G&A expenses** for company stage
- **Lack of expense discipline** in discretionary spending

### Profitability Red Flags
- **No path to profitability** visible in projections
- **Deteriorating unit economics**
- **Cash burn exceeding fundraising plans**
- **Negative gross margins** (unsustainable business model)

## Deep Dive into Revenue Analysis

Revenue analysis goes beyond simply looking at top-line growth. For founders, understanding revenue composition, trends, and quality is crucial for making strategic decisions and communicating with investors.

## Revenue Recognition and Quality

### Revenue Recognition Principles
Not all revenue is created equal. Understanding when and how to recognize revenue impacts both your P&L and decision-making.

#### Cash vs. Accrual Accounting Impact
**Cash Basis:**
- Revenue recorded when payment received
- Simple but can mislead on business performance
- Not GAAP compliant for most businesses

**Accrual Basis:**
- Revenue recorded when earned, regardless of payment timing
- Required for businesses with >$27M annual revenue
- Provides better picture of business performance

**Example Comparison:**
\`\`\`
Transaction: $50,000 annual contract signed Jan 1, paid in full

Cash Basis:
January: $50,000 revenue
Feb-Dec: $0 revenue

Accrual Basis:
Jan-Dec: $4,167 revenue per month ($50,000 √∑ 12)
\`\`\`

### Revenue Quality Assessment

#### High-Quality Revenue Characteristics
1. **Recurring and Predictable**
   - Subscription revenue
   - Long-term contracts
   - Repeat customers

2. **Diversified Customer Base**
   - No customer >10% of revenue
   - Multiple revenue streams
   - Geographic diversification

3. **Growing Average Contract Value**
   - Customers upgrading over time
   - Successful upselling/cross-selling
   - Premium pricing acceptance

4. **Strong Customer Retention**
   - Low churn rates
   - High Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
   - Expanding customer relationships

#### Revenue Quality Red Flags
- **Customer concentration risk** (few customers = majority of revenue)
- **One-time revenue spikes** without underlying business improvement
- **Declining average selling prices** due to competitive pressure
- **Channel conflict** or dependencies on single distribution partners

Period: 2 years

CAGR = ($1,800,000 √∑ $500,000)^(1/2) - 1
CAGR = (3.6)^0.5 - 1 = 89.7%

This represents very strong growth for a startup.
\`\`\`

### 3. Revenue Per Customer Metrics

#### Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
**Monthly ARPU Calculation:**
ARPU = Monthly Recurring Revenue √∑ Number of Active Users

\`\`\`
March 2024 ARPU Analysis:
MRR: $85,000
Active Users: 340
ARPU: $250/month

ARPU Trends:
Jan 2024: $230/month
Feb 2024: $240/month  
Mar 2024: $250/month

Analysis: ARPU growing 4.3% monthly, indicating successful 
upselling or premium feature adoption.
\`\`\`

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
**Simple CLV Calculation:**
CLV = (Average Monthly Revenue per Customer √ó Gross Margin %) √∑ Monthly Churn Rate

\`\`\`
CLV Calculation Example:
Average Monthly Revenue: $250
Gross Margin: 80%
Monthly Churn Rate: 2%

CLV = ($250 √ó 0.80) √∑ 0.02 = $10,000

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $500
CLV:CAC Ratio: 20:1 (Excellent - target is 3:1 minimum)

## Profitability Metrics Deep Dive

### 1. Gross Profit Analysis

#### Gross Margin Trends
\`\`\`
Quarterly Gross Margin Analysis:
                Revenue    COGS    Gross Profit  Gross Margin
Q4 2023        $270,000   $81,000   $189,000      70.0%
Q1 2024        $330,000   $89,100   $240,900      73.0%
Q2 2024        $360,000   $93,600   $266,400      74.0%

Trend Analysis:
- Gross margin improving quarter over quarter
- COGS growing slower than revenue (good efficiency)
- Q2 margin approaching SaaS benchmark of 75-85%
\`\`\`

#### Unit Economics
**Per-Customer Unit Economics:**
\`\`\`
Average Customer Metrics:
Monthly Revenue per Customer:     $250
Monthly COGS per Customer:        $65
Monthly Gross Profit per Customer: $185
Monthly Gross Margin:             74%

Annual Customer Economics:
Annual Revenue per Customer:      $3,000
Annual COGS per Customer:         $780
Annual Gross Profit per Customer: $2,220
\`\`\`

### 2. Operating Leverage Analysis

Operating leverage measures how operating income changes relative to sales changes.

#### Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)
**Formula:** DOL = % Change in EBIT √∑ % Change in Sales

\`\`\`
Operating Leverage Example:

Q1 to Q2 2024:
Sales Growth: 9.1% ($330K to $360K)
EBIT Growth: 25% ($15K to $18.75K)

DOL = 25% √∑ 9.1% = 2.75

Analysis: For every 1% increase in sales, EBIT increases 
2.75%. High operating leverage indicates good scalability.
\`\`\`

#### Fixed vs. Variable Cost Analysis
\`\`\`
Cost Structure Analysis:

Variable Costs (scale with revenue):
- Payment processing fees: 2.9% of revenue
- Hosting/infrastructure: ~1.5% of revenue  
- Customer support: ~2% of revenue
Total Variable Costs: 6.4% of revenue

Fixed Costs (don't scale with revenue):
- Salaries and benefits: $45,000/month
- Office rent: $4,000/month
- Software licenses: $3,500/month
- Other fixed: $7,500/month
Total Fixed Costs: $60,000/month

Break-even Analysis:
Break-even Revenue = Fixed Costs √∑ (1 - Variable Cost %)
Break-even = $60,000 √∑ (1 - 0.064) = $64,103/month

Current Revenue: $120,000/month
Safety Margin: 87% above break-even
\`\`\`

### 3. Advanced Profitability Metrics

#### Contribution Margin
**By Product/Service Line:**
\`\`\`
Product Line Analysis:

SaaS Platform:
Revenue: $85,000
Variable Costs: $8,500 (10%)
Contribution Margin: $76,500 (90%)

Professional Services:  
Revenue: $35,000
Variable Costs: $21,000 (60% - labor intensive)
Contribution Margin: $14,000 (40%)

Weighted Average Contribution Margin:
($76,500 + $14,000) √∑ $120,000 = 75.4%
\`\`\`

#### Customer Acquisition Payback Period
**Formula:** Payback Period = Customer Acquisition Cost √∑ Monthly Gross Profit per Customer

\`\`\`
Payback Period Calculation:
CAC: $500 (blended across all channels)
Monthly Gross Profit per Customer: $185
Payback Period: $500 √∑ $185 = 2.7 months

Channel-Specific Analysis:
Paid Advertising CAC: $650, Payback: 3.5 months
Organic/Referral CAC: $200, Payback: 1.1 months
Content Marketing CAC: $350, Payback: 1.9 months

Strategy: Focus more investment on organic and content 
channels with faster payback periods.

## Understanding the Balance Sheet

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of your company's financial position at a specific point in time. Unlike the P&L statement which shows performance over a period, the balance sheet shows what you own (assets), what you owe (liabilities), and what's left over (equity) at a specific date.

## The Fundamental Accounting Equation

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This equation must always balance, which is why it's called a "balance sheet."

### Why This Equation Matters
- **Assets** represent resources available to generate future economic benefits
- **Liabilities** represent obligations that must be fulfilled
- **Equity** represents the owners' residual interest in the company

## Assets Analysis

### Current Assets (Converted to Cash within 12 months)

#### Cash and Cash Equivalents
**Components:**
- Checking and savings accounts
- Money market accounts  
- Certificates of deposit (< 90 days)
- Treasury bills and short-term investments

**Analysis Questions:**
- Is cash sufficient for current operations?
- How many months of expenses does cash cover?
- Are cash levels appropriate for business stage?

**Cash Runway Calculation:**
\`\`\`
Monthly Cash Burn: $35,000
Current Cash: $125,000
Cash Runway: $125,000 √∑ $35,000 = 3.6 months

Analysis: Runway is tight for early-stage company. 
Need to focus on cash generation or fundraising.
\`\`\`

#### Accounts Receivable
Money owed by customers for goods/services already delivered.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** = (A/R √∑ Daily Sales)
- **A/R Turnover** = Annual Sales √∑ Average A/R
- **Collection Period** = 365 √∑ A/R Turnover

**DSO Calculation Example:**
\`\`\`
Accounts Receivable: $82,500
Annual Sales: $1,440,000  
Daily Sales: $1,440,000 √∑ 365 = $3,945
DSO: $82,500 √∑ $3,945 = 21 days

Benchmark: SaaS companies typically have 30-45 day DSO
Analysis: Collection period is excellent, indicating 
good customer payment behavior.
\`\`\`

**Red Flags:**
- DSO increasing over time
- Large receivables from few customers
- Receivables older than standard payment terms
- Increasing allowance for doubtful accounts

#### Prepaid Expenses

\`\`\`

## Working Capital Analysis

### Working Capital Components

**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**
\`\`\`
Current Assets: $240,000
Current Liabilities: $135,000
Working Capital: $105,000
\`\`\`

### Working Capital Metrics

#### Current Ratio
\`\`\`
Current Ratio = Current Assets √∑ Current Liabilities
Current Ratio = $240,000 √∑ $135,000 = 1.78

Interpretation:
- > 2.0: Very strong liquidity
- 1.5-2.0: Good liquidity  
- 1.0-1.5: Adequate liquidity
- < 1.0: Liquidity concerns

Analysis: 1.78 shows good short-term liquidity.
\`\`\`

#### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
\`\`\`
Quick Assets = Cash + A/R + Marketable Securities
Quick Ratio = Quick Assets √∑ Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = ($125,000 + $82,500) √∑ $135,000 = 1.54

Analysis: Strong quick ratio indicates ability 
to pay current obligations without selling inventory.
\`\`\`

#### Cash Ratio
\`\`\`
Cash Ratio = Cash √∑ Current Liabilities
Cash Ratio = $125,000 √∑ $135,000 = 0.93

Analysis: High cash ratio provides flexibility
and security for operations.
\`\`\`

### Working Capital Management

#### Cash Conversion Cycle
Measures time from cash outlay to cash collection.

**Formula:**
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

Where:
- DSO = Days Sales Outstanding
- DIO = Days Inventory Outstanding  
- DPO = Days Payable Outstanding

\`\`\`
Example Calculation:
DSO: 21 days (calculated earlier)
DIO: 45 days (if applicable)
DPO: 30 days (calculated earlier)

CCC = 21 + 45 - 30 = 36 days

Analysis: Takes 36 days from spending cash
to collecting cash from customers.
\`\`\`

## Balance Sheet Ratios for Financial Health

\`\`\`

### Leverage Ratios
Measure financial risk and capital structure.

\`\`\`
Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt √∑ Total Assets
Debt-to-Assets = $95,000 √∑ $440,000 = 21.6%

Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt √∑ Total Equity  
Debt-to-Equity = $95,000 √∑ $210,000 = 45.2%

Times Interest Earned = EBIT √∑ Interest Expense
(Calculated from P&L statement)

Analysis: Conservative leverage levels provide
financial flexibility and lower risk.
\`\`\`

### Efficiency Ratios
Measure how effectively assets are used.

\`\`\`
Asset Turnover = Revenue √∑ Average Total Assets
Asset Turnover = $1,440,000 √∑ $440,000 = 3.27

Analysis: Company generates $3.27 of revenue
for every dollar of assets, indicating
efficient asset utilization.

## Working Capital: The Lifeblood of Business Operations

Working capital management is one of the most critical aspects of running a healthy business. It determines your ability to pay bills, invest in growth, and weather unexpected challenges. For growing companies, poor working capital management is often the difference between thriving and merely surviving.

## Understanding Working Capital Components

### Working Capital Formula
**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**

### Components Breakdown

#### Current Assets (convertible to cash within 12 months)
1. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**
2. **Accounts Receivable** 
3. **Inventory** (if applicable)
4. **Prepaid Expenses**
5. **Other Short-term Assets**

#### Current Liabilities (due within 12 months)
1. **Accounts Payable**
2. **Accrued Expenses**
3. **Short-term Debt**
4. **Deferred Revenue**
5. **Payroll and Tax Liabilities**

### Working Capital Analysis Example
\`\`\`
TechCorp Working Capital Analysis - March 2024:

Current Assets:
  Cash                    $150,000
  Accounts Receivable     $120,000
  Prepaid Expenses        $25,000
  Other Current Assets    $15,000
  Total Current Assets    $310,000

Current Liabilities:
  Accounts Payable        $45,000
  Accrued Expenses        $30,000
  Short-term Debt         $25,000
  Deferred Revenue        $65,000
  Payroll/Tax Liabilities $20,000
  Total Current Liabilities $185,000

Working Capital = $310,000 - $185,000 = $125,000

Working Capital Ratio = $310,000 √∑ $185,000 = 1.68
\`\`\`

## Working Capital Metrics and Analysis

### 1. Liquidity Ratios

#### Current Ratio
**Formula:** Current Assets √∑ Current Liabilities

\`\`\`
Interpretation Guidelines:
> 2.5: May indicate excess cash not being utilized
2.0-2.5: Strong liquidity position  
1.5-2.0: Good liquidity (ideal range for most businesses)
1.0-1.5: Adequate but requires monitoring
< 1.0: Liquidity concerns, may struggle to pay bills

Industry Variations:
- SaaS companies: 1.2-2.0 (due to deferred revenue)
- Consulting: 1.5-2.5 (irregular cash flows)
- E-commerce: 1.0-1.5 (fast inventory turnover)
- Manufacturing: 2.0-3.0 (inventory and longer cycles)
\`\`\`

#### Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)
**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) √∑ Current Liabilities

\`\`\`
Quick Ratio Example:
Current Assets: $310,000
Inventory: $10,000  
Current Liabilities: $185,000

Quick Ratio = ($310,000 - $10,000) √∑ $185,000 = 1.62

Analysis: Strong quick ratio indicates company can 
meet short-term obligations without relying on 
inventory conversion to cash.
\`\`\`

#### Cash Ratio
**Formula:** (Cash + Marketable Securities) √∑ Current Liabilities

\`\`\`
Cash Ratio = $150,000 √∑ $185,000 = 0.81

Analysis: High cash ratio provides maximum flexibility
for operations and unexpected opportunities.
Target range: 0.1-0.2 for mature companies,
0.3-1.0+ for early-stage companies.
\`\`\`

### 2. Activity Ratios (Efficiency Metrics)

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
**Formula:** (Accounts Receivable √∑ Net Sales) √ó 365

\`\`\`
DSO Calculation:
Accounts Receivable: $120,000
Annual Net Sales: $2,160,000
Daily Sales: $5,918

DSO = $120,000 √∑ $5,918 = 20.3 days

Analysis: Excellent collection period. Most B2B 
companies have 30-60 day DSO.

DSO Benchmarks by Industry:
- SaaS (monthly billing): 15-30 days
- SaaS (annual billing): 30-45 days  
- Consulting services: 45-75 days
- Manufacturing: 60-90 days
- Retail/E-commerce: 1-5 days
\`\`\`

#### Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)
**Formula:** (Accounts Payable √∑ Cost of Goods Sold) √ó 365

\`\`\`
DPO Calculation:
Accounts Payable: $45,000
Annual COGS: $540,000
Daily COGS: $1,479

DPO = $45,000 √∑ $1,479 = 30.4 days

Analysis: Company pays suppliers in ~30 days, 
which aligns with standard payment terms.

DPO Strategy:
- Too high: Risk supplier relationship damage
- Too low: Missing cash flow optimization opportunity
- Optimal: Maximize without damaging relationships
\`\`\`

#### Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
**Formula:** (Average Inventory √∑ COGS) √ó 365

\`\`\`
DIO Calculation (for companies with inventory):
Average Inventory: $35,000
Annual COGS: $540,000
Daily COGS: $1,479

DIO = $35,000 √∑ $1,479 = 23.7 days

Analysis: Fast inventory turnover indicates 
efficient inventory management.

DIO Benchmarks:
- Software/SaaS: 0-10 days (minimal inventory)
- Consulting: 0-5 days  
- E-commerce: 30-90 days
- Manufacturing: 60-120 days
- Retail: 45-90 days
\`\`\`

### 3. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

**Formula:** CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

\`\`\`
Cash Conversion Cycle Calculation:
DSO: 20.3 days
DIO: 5 days (minimal for software company)  
DPO: 30.4 days

CCC = 20.3 + 5 - 30.4 = -5.1 days

Analysis: Negative CCC is excellent! Company 
collects cash from customers before paying suppliers,
creating positive cash flow timing.

CCC Interpretation:
Negative: Suppliers essentially finance operations
0-30 days: Excellent working capital efficiency  
30-60 days: Good efficiency
60+ days: May indicate inefficiencies
\`\`\`
