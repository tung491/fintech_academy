## The Strategic Role of FP&A in Growing Tech Companies

Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) transforms from a support function to a strategic driver as tech companies scale from Series A through IPO. This lesson establishes the foundation for building world-class FP&A capabilities.

### Understanding FP&A Evolution by Stage

**Series A Stage (10-50 employees)**
- Basic financial reporting and cash management
- Simple budget creation and tracking
- Founder-led financial decision making
- Limited financial systems and processes
- Focus on runway extension and growth metrics

**Series B/C Stage (50-200 employees)**
- Dedicated FP&A function establishment
- Advanced financial modeling and forecasting
- Board-level financial reporting and analysis
- Department-level budget management
- Investor reporting and compliance

**Pre-IPO/Growth Stage (200+ employees)**
- Sophisticated FP&A organization
- Real-time financial analytics and dashboards
- Complex scenario modeling and planning
- Integration with operational systems
- Public company reporting preparation

### Core FP&A Functions
